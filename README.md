- 👋 Hi, I’m Cisco a Full Stack developer with a curious mind - always looking to learn something new.
- 👀 I’m interested in building a wide array of applications: video games, AI, research, enterprise.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python! Feel in love with its versatility and simplicity. C++ is next on my list.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source JavaScript or Python project; as a new developer, I am looking to learn from those with more experience than me.
- 📫 How to reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c0d3cisco/) or email me at c0d3cisco@yahoo.com
